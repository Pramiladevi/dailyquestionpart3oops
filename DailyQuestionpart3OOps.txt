2.What is Polymorphism? explain types?
*Polymorphism is the  ability of any data to be processed in more than one form.
*It has 2types 
   1)  method overriding
   2)  method overloading
method overriding
*Sub class has the  same method as declared in the parent class,it is known as method overriding.
method overloading
*A class has multiple methods having same name but different parameters,it is known as method overloading.

         Chromiumdriver-extends-Remotewebdriver)selenium 
    *  (Arraylist -Extends-Abstractlist
          Abstractlist-Extends-Abstractcollection)Java

5.Difference between multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance
multiple inheritance
*It inherits characteristics and features from more than one parent object or parent class.(it is not supported in java).
multilevel inheritance
*There is a chain of inheritance(eg:baby dog class inherits dog class,dog class inherits animal class).

6.Is multiple inheritance possible in java?
No,multiple inheritance is not possible in java.

7.What is keyword for using inheritance  
*extends is the keyword  using for inheritance.

8.what is the keyword to connect interface and class
*implements  is the keyword to connect interface and class.

9.what is difference between class and interface
class
*A class describes the attributes and behaviors of an object.  
*A class may contain abstract methods, concrete methods.
interface
*An interface contains behaviors that a class implements.
 *An interface contains only abstract methods 

10.what is difference between class and abstract class
class
*Class method can have body.
*Class can declared as final.
abstract calss
*Abstract methods cannot have body.
*Abstract class can have static fields and static method, like other classes.
*An abstract class cannot be declared as final.
